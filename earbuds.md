<h2>Why my earbuds?</h2>
<p>I bring my earbuds with me everyday because I constantly listent to music. These are some JBL earbuds I bought on sale 2 years ago and they still hold up. I used to have airpods but they constantly broke or didn't work or charge to the point that I felt like I was paying a subscription just to use them with all the maintence costs. Overall, I keep these charged and ready, and don't leave the house without them so my walks on campus are more interesting.</p>
