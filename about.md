<h2>Why the wallet?</h2>
<p>Although it is obvious, I do use my wallet everyday. I somehow ended up with a ridge wallet and regret having to actually use this thing on a daily basis. On the surface, the wallet sounds cool, its compact, has a unique design, and some security against RFID. Despite these perks, in practice this wallet only ends in more time at the grocery store trying to interpret what card I need to pull out and wasting other peoples time in the process. If I could go back in time and choose another wallet, I would rather have a 5 dollar Hello Kitty Wallet that is torn in half than this thing. Regardless, I am stuck with it.</p>
